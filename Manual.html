You only have to go through the setup process once.
<P>
The order of setup is as follows:
<P><U>

You can change the default field names for manufacturer, serial number and model.

<P><U>

Here you can choose whether to allow WorkTracer to provide sequential ticket numbers (recommended) or use your own ticket numbers (which must be 8 alphanumeric characters).
<P><U>
1.9 Configure email</U><BR>

If you are going to use WorkTracer to send emails to customers you need to configure 
your email settings.  You can usually find these settings from your existing email program.
<P>The port number defaults to 25.  You should not need to change this.
<P>If you don't know the settings you can configure the email later by selecting Configure email 
from the Setup menu.

<P><U>
1.10 Password for the Setup commands</U><BR>

 same item is in for repair again.  If you have specified the ticket number for the existing customer, the appropriate item will be 
highlighted.

<P>
In the customer details section the require fields are the name and the customer number.  The program will prompt with the customer number, but you may override this.  Duplicate numbers are not allowed.  If the customer name is a company, you may also enter the name of the contact person.
<P>

the customer's email address you will also have the option of emailing the ticket details to the customer.  
You need to configure your email first (Setup menu -> Configure email).

from the Miscellaneous submenu of the Setup menu.  The drop lists will be populated with data from past tickets when you start a new ticket.

select the Manufacturer, Model and Brief description, in that order.  Then click on the field for Work required so that
 is in focus.  WorkTracer will search the database for the last instance of those fields and populate the Work required accordingly.

chassis number, etc).  This information will be saved as soon as you click on OK.  You can also customize the field names by clicking on the buttons at the
 bottom of the window.

prints on return labels, 1-3/4 inch x 1/2 inch, 80 per sheet, such as Avery # 8167.  If a label printer
 is used we recommend 29 mm x 90 mm labels.  The customer name and/or work description, ticket 
number, and corresponding Code 39 barcode are printed on the ticket.  You may change the options for 
printing labels by selecting Labelling from the Print options submenu of the Setup menu.
<P>If you specify a label printer you can make the program print directly to the label printer without 
showing the printer dialog by clicking on Select the label printer and selecting the printer from 
the list.  If you select the Default printer the printer dialog will still be shown.

will be asked to choose if the account is a regular customer or an account holder.
<P>
You may obtain a report on the status of account holders by selecting Account holders from the Accounts submenu of the Reports menu.

<LI>Run the WorkTracer installation program on your server.  Make the WorkTracer folder a shared folder and be sure to check the box to allow other users 
to change files.
<LI>Run the WorkTracer installation program on each of your workstations (this will register some 
files with the Windows registry).  
<LI>Modify the WorkTracer shortcut on each of your workstation desktops, so that the target is 
the WorkTracer.exe file on your server and the “Start in” folder is the shared WorkTracer folder on 
your server.  An alternative to this is to delete the desktop shortcut.  Then open the shared folder 
on the server from the workstation, right drag (holding the right mouse button down) the 
WorkTracer.exe file onto the desktop on the workstation and select Create Shortcut Here.
<LI>Make sure that you have specified that WorkTracer will be run on a network by selecting 
Ticket numbering from the Setup menu.
</OL>
Please note that if you change the WorkTracer setup on any of your computers you must restart WorkTracer on the other computers for the changes to take effect.

22.  Accessing TrackEasy customers</B><P>

TrackEasy is GrenSoft’s rental software.  If you are running both TrackEasy and WorkTracer, you can access the TrackEasy customer database from WorkTracer.
<P>
For this to take place, both programs must be installed on the same drive.  For example, WorkTracer would be installed in C:\WorkTracer, and TrackEasy in C:\TrackEasy.
<P>
If the two programs are installed correctly, when you start a new ticket there will be a checkbox for Find in TrackEasy database when you search for the customer.  Check this box, then enter the customer number or part of the customer’s name 
or any part of any line of the address (eg the zip or postal code, minimum 3 characters) 
or the last 4 digits of the phone number.  WorkTracer will then search the TrackEasy database for the customer and enter the details in the new ticket.
<P>
Please note that this is the limit of the integration between the two programs.  For example customer account balances are stored separately in the two programs.  Also, if customer details are edited in one program, the changes will not automatically appear in the other.

<P><CENTER><A HREF=#_top>TOP</A></CENTER><P><A NAME=Item_23><B>
23.  Options for ticket & invoice numbering</B><P>

By default, merchandise sales are numbered in the same way as repair tickets.  You may choose to number the sales separately so that a sales ticket begins with the letter M (eg M0000001).
<P>
Also by default, the ticket number is saved at the start of a transaction, so that if the program is being run on a network two workstations cannot create duplicate ticket numbers.  This means that if a ticket is started then cancelled the ticket number will be lost and the numbers will not be sequential.  If you are not running the program on a network you can choose to save the ticket number when the ticket is saved, so that numbers are sequential (with no missing numbers).
<P>
You may choose to use your own ticket numbering system instead of having WorkTracer allocate the numbers.  
Ticket numbers must comprise 8 alphanumeric characters.  Duplicate numbers are not allowed.
<P>You may also choose to use your own invoice numbering system instead of using the ticket number for the invoice number.
<P>
You can set up the system for ticket and invoice numbering by selecting Ticket & invoice numbering from the Setup menu.

<P><CENTER><A HREF=#_top>TOP</A></CENTER><P><A NAME=Item_24><B>
24.  Recalls</B><P>

WorkTracer allows you to create reminders for recalls to let you know when an item of equipment 
will be due for recall (eg for recalibration, inspection, etc).
<P>
You can set up this option by selecting Recalls from the Setup menu.
<P>
After you have set up the option, each time you close a ticket you will be prompted to set
 up a reminder to recall the equipment.  For this prompt to appear you must have entered 
the type of equipment and/or the serial number on the ticket.
<P>
Select the time interval which must elapse before the recall and enter the reason why
 the equipment should be recalled (optional).
<P>
You can generate a report on recalls for a specified month by selecting 
Recalls from the Customers submenu of the Reports menu.
<P>
When you start the program each day, it checks to see if any recalls are due on that day.  
If so, you will be asked if you wish to print the recalls.
<P>
Recalls are automatically deleted from the system after the recall date has passed.

does not require repairs.
<P>
To do this, select Add customer from the Tickets menu.  Enter the customer's details.
<P>
You can also modify the details of a customer (address, phone, etc) by selecting Edit customer from

<P>The WebLink module allows your customers to check the status of their jobs and the availability of stock online.
<P>
To allow customers to check the status of jobs you should place a link on your Web site to the query page which is uploaded by WorkTracer using the WebLink.
 The name of the query file is query.php. To allow them to check the availability of stock you should link to the file stock.php.
<P>To set up the WebLink, select WebLink from the Setup menu. The required fields are: 
<UL>
<LI>Web site address: this would be of the form www.yoursite.com. 
<LI>Name of PHP file to link to: you should link to the file query.php. 
<LI>Path to PHP file on server: this is the directory where the php file will reside on your server. The directory where HTML files normally reside varies from server to server. It could be, for example, httpdocs. You can also place the php files in a subfolder (eg httpdocs/php). 
<LI>FTP user ID: your user ID for ftp transfer. 
<LI>FTP password: your password for ftp transfer. 
</UL><P>

<P>
To enable the ftp transfer, check the Enable connection box.  
<P>
If you check the box to upload files automatically, each time you sell stock or change the status of a ticket
 or edit the notes then save the ticket, the WebLink files will be uploaded to reflect the changes.
<P>Alternatively you can upload the files manually by selecting Upload WebLink files from the File menu, 
clicking on the two computers icon on the toolbar or pressing Ctrl + U.
