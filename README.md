WorkTracer

WorkTracer is a piece of software originally developed by GrenSoft which has had no further updates since 5.6 and is considered as abandonware.

I have found the need for this software in my workplace and have since been working on decompiling and dissasembling parts of it to be updated in new custom revisions.

I claim no ownership over the name WorkTracer or any of the original codebase created by GrenSoft.
